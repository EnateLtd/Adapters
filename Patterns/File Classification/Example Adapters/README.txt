This code defines an Azure Function in C# based on the provided OpenAPI specification. The Azure Function includes three HTTP-triggered endpoints: `GetFileClassification`, `GetModelList`, and `TestAdapterConfiguration`.

`GetFileClassification`: This endpoint is triggered by an HTTP POST request to the `/FileClassification` URL. It expects a JSON payload in the request body containing `FileDetailsForClassification` data model. The function performs file classification logic and returns a JSON response containing the `FileClassificationResult` data model.

`GetModelList`: This endpoint is triggered by an HTTP POST request to the `/ModelList` URL. It expects a JSON payload in the request body containing `ModelListRequest` data model. The function retrieves a list of models based on the request and returns a JSON response containing the `ModelListResult` data model.

`testAdapterConfiguration`: This endpoint is triggered by an HTTP POST request to the `/TestConfiguration` URL. It expects a JSON payload in the request body containing `AdapterConfigurationEntryResult` data model. The function performs configuration testing logic and returns a JSON response containing the `TestConfigurationResults` data model.
